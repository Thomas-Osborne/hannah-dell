    "abstract": "<div>We investigated how stability conditions behave under actions of fusion categories (=<em>tensor categories with extra structure</em>). A crucial example is that, if a finite group \\(G\\) acts on a category \\(\\mathcal{D}\\), then the corresponding \\(G\\)-equivariant category \\(\\mathcal{D}^G\\) is a module category over \\(\\mathrm{rep}(G)\\) (which is a fusion category). As an application, we generalise results from <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00815\">my first project</a> to non abelian groups.</div>",
